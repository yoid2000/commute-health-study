      \caption{Error between each method's p-values and the original p-values. P-values are significant when $p \leq 0.05$. P-values are binned as $p \leq 0.001$, $0.001 < p \leq 0.01$, and $0.01 < p \leq 0.05$. Off by 1 means that the method's bin is one off from the original data's bin (both being significant). Off by 2 means that the method's bin is two off from the original data's bin.
